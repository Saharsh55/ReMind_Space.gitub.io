      title: 'Box Breathing for Stress Relief',
      category: 'coping',
      description: 'Learn the box breathing technique to reduce stress and anxiety.',
      content: `Box breathing, also known as square breathing or 4-4-4-4 breathing, is a powerful technique used by Navy SEALs, first responders, and healthcare workers to manage stress and maintain focus under pressure.

**What is Box Breathing?**
Box breathing is a simple but effective breathing technique that involves breathing in a specific pattern to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps calm the mind and body.

**The Technique:**
Imagine drawing a box with your breath:

1. **Inhale for 4 counts** - Breathe in slowly through your nose
2. **Hold for 4 counts** - Retain the breath in your lungs
3. **Exhale for 4 counts** - Breathe out slowly through your mouth
4. **Hold empty for 4 counts** - Pause before the next inhale

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. Find a comfortable seated position
2. Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly
3. Close your eyes or soften your gaze
4. Begin the 4-4-4-4 pattern
5. Focus on the counting and the sensation of breathing
6. Continue for 4-10 cycles

**When to Use Box Breathing:**
- Before stressful situations
- During panic attacks
- When feeling overwhelmed
- Before bed to promote sleep
- Anytime you need to center yourself

**Benefits:**
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Lowers heart rate and blood pressure
- Improves focus and concentration
- Promotes emotional regulation
- Enhances sleep quality

**Tips for Success:**
- Start with shorter counts if 4 feels too long
- Practice regularly when calm
- Don't strain - breathing should feel natural
- If you feel dizzy, return to normal breathing

With practice, box breathing becomes a reliable tool you can use anywhere, anytime.`,
